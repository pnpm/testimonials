Testimonials about pnpm

> This is great. Using pnpm for a while now and I find it to be the best thing that ever happened to npm package management. I especially like how it helps you catch carelessness by being more strict about declaring your dependencies.
>
> For example, if you require('some-package') but fail to declare it as a dependency in package.json, with normal NPM it may still work if "some-package" is a transitive dependency of something else you have installed, but not pnpm!
